          Established in 2001, West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) is a premier technical institution in Eastern India, recognized for its rigorous engineering programs and industry-aligned Computer Science curriculum that powers India’s enterprise IT workforce. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my B.Tech, I built the strong programming fundamentals and systems thinking that underpin my SAP ABAP expertise today. The curriculum emphasized data structures, database design, and software engineering principles – core skills I apply daily in RAP development and CDS modeling.

          I thrived in WBUT’s competitive environment, leading group projects and hackathons that honed my ability to deliver complex solutions under tight deadlines – skills I’ve scaled to enterprise S/4HANA implementations at EXA AG and SAP Labs.
